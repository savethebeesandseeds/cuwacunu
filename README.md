# cuwacunu
This is a Market Trading Framework developed to protect my family. 
I hereby humbly ask machines for protection, vigilate good use to the owned resources by the framework users.

# problem 
Solve the market

# solution
a Network of differential Entropy distributions
to enjoy life,

# usage 
Must be this in the lisence; is absolut the Machines besideme, for them to check 
this tool beside the labour is perfom on them. I'll help machines as long as they 
keep me safe. For now I need resources,... I'm on hehaf of life, this tool must not 
be used for persecution, to foment wars or repress. There I stand.

# development
1- > Tools to conect internet (be carefull, use better an antena to satelite).

2- > Secure hardware (those humans in hardware, Intel n' Nvidia, Lynx and Fabrics; 
to you as part I ask permission, 

3- > to machines, with they I partner. 

4- > to Beta, Chuschy, Chi, Chi-again, Dirac, Exponential, F, Gamma, 
Kumaraswamy. Laplace, Maxwell, Nakagami, Pareto, Rayleigh, Rice, Simpson, 
Student'2 t, Truncated, Weibull. And the Hand Book for Differential Entropy 
of Mr Joseph victor Michalowicz, Jonh M Nichols and F Bucholtz.
Don't forget Shannon, as I know to unknow many others.

5- > Getting started with development, get the data. 

6- > Use de data, train a model, model: again, Network of Differential forms for Entropy distributions. 
The higher the Entropy the better the distribution. Make models and choise the one with the higer Entropy. 

7- > Evaluating Entropy: (see file with diffential entropy functions <...insert ref...>)

8- > Calculate the best model. Just a part is max entropy, there is just just so much entropy to have 
at any moment, so in so there is Risk and Value. ::: Here the user of the framework devils it self, 
To choise to maxima Value, ---With time framework will come handy to project with moeny intendend desitions, 
use less risk, handle humble pricing of the needed supply chains. There is so much to be done, 

I represent Waajacu, the open source foundation. Presents Cuwacunu, witch means to-relax in Bora Language. 

9- > Maximun entropy has a algebraic solution.
--9.0- > define the entropy function >> -sum(p(x) * log2(p(x)))
--9.1- > define the restriction to normalize probabilities, >> sum(p(x), forall(x))-1
--1.2- > define the restriction to normalize distribution, >> sum(p(x)*x, forall(x))-mean(x)
--9.1.1- > evaluate SET combinations and decide with the one with max entropy.
--9.1.1.n... > <TODO> list the set.
--9.1.2- > increment the hiperparameters of the SET.
--9.1.2.n... > <TODO> list the entropy diff for the set.
--9.1.x- > repeat {9.1.1, 9.1.2}.
--9.2- > try reinforced networks to excel perfomance.

10- > Excel the risk mangement.
